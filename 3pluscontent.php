    During my time as the Marketing and Communication Assistant for the Economic
    Development Agency of my city, Greater Moncton, I was tasked to write to
    content for a full overhaul of the companyâ€™s website. The main objective was
    to describe to our community exactly who we are and how we help with the growth of our Economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    By working closely with everyone in the company, I was able to describe the 3 main components of the company: Entrepreneurship, Workforce Development, and Investment Attraction. Combined, I wrote the content for total of 36 news pages, created a toolkit for entrepreneurs, and redesigned the Home page.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the actual UX design of the site, I worked with our external third-party
    to ensure the brand identity  was respected as well as keeping a
    modern and pleasing esthetic. All while making sure we were respecting our
    agreed upon deadlines.
